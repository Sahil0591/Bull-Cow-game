# Bull and Cow - A Number Guessing Game

To run the game you must download the Bull & Cow game folder, make sure you have Python installed on your system and then run the GUI.py file

## 📝 About the Game

Bull and Cow is a number-guessing game implemented using Python's tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI). The game generates a random four-digit number with non-repeating digits, and the player must guess it within 11 attempts.

Bulls 🐂: Correct digits in the correct positions.

Cows 🐄: Correct digits in the wrong positions.

The game provides feedback after each guess.

The game ends when the player guesses the number correctly (4 Bulls) or exhausts all 11 attempts.

The Submit button is disabled after 11 attempts to prevent further guesses.

## 🎮 How to Play

Click on the number buttons to enter a four-digit guess (digits must be unique).

Click Submit to check your guess.

The game will display the number of Bulls and Cows for your guess.

Keep guessing until:

You get 4 Bulls (Win 🎉)

You reach 11 attempts (Lose ❌)

If you lose, the game disables further inputs.
